## CSE 6242 Semester Project: Atlanta Livability Index
This is the semester project for a Data and Visualization class; the team chose to do a livability indicator for the city of Atlanta to find out which location of the Greater Atlanta Metro area you should in based off of your selected preferences. 

## Technology Used
The main framework for this application is React and it is deployed to GitHub pages. The team will be the first to note it does not take advantage of the entire React framework regarding state, props, and functional components. The reason for this is because the app uses D3.js to render the algorithm's output. Integrating React and D3.js was a difficult task and modifications to how the code should operate using React were changed. The main library used other than D3 was react-d3-bubble, which is an npm library. However, the team had to download the code, modify it, and plug it into the main code base because the library did not offer all the team needed out-of-the-box.

## Backlog
Integrate with Google API to show heatmap of Atlanta divided by hub's GEOID.
Develop an API to expose the team's data on Google Cloud Platform
Modify the current code base to read the data from the above API
Refactor the code base to take full advantage of the React Framework

## How to run the project
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
